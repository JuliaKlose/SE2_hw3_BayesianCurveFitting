Read me:

This program is a Java program of Bayesian curve fitting, which can provide prediction of stock price.
The data has been added in the CurveFitting folder, which could be run in the code.

In the Bayesian prediction, a is set to 0.005, b is set to 11.1, M is set to 5.
CurveFitting.java, ReadCVS.java, Prediction.java are be added in folder”CurveFitting/src/Jama;”.

For running the code successfully, JRE and JVM 1.8 is needed. Jama 1.0.3 should be import.
